# Text Summarization

# We can do summarization using two method
# i)  Extractive Text Summarization
# ii) Abstractive Text Summarization

# i)  Extractive Text Summarization
# tradional method for summarization, It takes less time to summarize, it dosen't produce new text
from the given paragraph. It checks which statement is important then it takes that statements 
using priority

# ex:)             He is good. Nilesh is intelligent guy. He has three brothores.
# answer will be:) Nilesh is intelligent guy. He is good

# There are some methods which follow this approch.
a)  TextRank Algorithm
b)  LexRank
c)  Luhn
d)  Latent Semantic Analysis, LSA
e)  KL-Sum


# ii) Abstractive Text Summarization
# advanced method for summarization, It more time than extractive method, because,
which generates new sentences that could best represent the whole text. 

# ex:)             He is good. Nilesh is intelligent guy. He has three brothores.
# answer will be:) Nilesh is smart and good guy.
